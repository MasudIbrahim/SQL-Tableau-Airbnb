# Airbnb in NYC from 2011 to 2019  üè° 

### Background info
I used an airbnb [dataset](ab_nyc.csv) to answer questions useful to those looking for a rental in NYC.<BR>
I transformed the raw data by creating a dashboard in Tableau and used SQL queries to back up the findings.

### Findings
The top host in NYC by total reviews is Maya with 2273 reviews and an avg price of $42.60 in East Elmhurst, Queens.<BR>
Maya's avg price is nearly half of the avg price of East Elmhurst, Queens which has an avg price of $81.18  

We can also see that Manhattan is the most popular neighbourhood with the most bookings and entire homes/apts make up the majority of the bookings with 13193.<BR>
